# REVelry
Repository for proposed papers and presentations.

## General Rules
- If someone mentions something they are working on, you don't get to take it home but you might be able to help.
- If you want to contribure to someone's efforts, reach out to them directly and cordially.
- You may not recruit here, but you can reach out to individuals if you are looking for a new role yourself.

## Participation
Participation is easy, just use the Google Meet linke in the invite you have.

### I don't have a meeting invite
Just reach out to `n3ar#2697` on discord if you would like to join a meeting or send an email to n3ar0h+REV@gmail.com.

### I gave a presentation, what should I do with the slides?
Open a PR with the file appropriately named! If you presented and you **don't** remember to open a PR with it, now worries! I will open one for you.

### How do I suggest a paper I want the group to cover?
Open a PR with the added paper at the bottom of the proposed presentations list. If you think it should be addressed sooner, add it where you think it belongs and justify it.

### Can I suggest an adjusted paper order?
Sure! Open a PR and we can discuss in the PR or at the next meeting.

### How do I volunteer to present on a paper?
Toss your name next to the paper you want to present and submit a PR.
