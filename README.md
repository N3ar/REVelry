# REVelry
Repository for proposed papers and presentations.

## General Rules
- If someone mentions something they are working on, you don't get to take it home but you might be able to help.
- If you want to contribure to someone's efforts, reach out to them directly and cordially.
- You may not recruit here, but you can reach out to individuals if you are looking for a new role yourself.

## Participation
Participation is easy, just use the Google Meet link in the invite you have.

### I don't have a meeting invite
Just reach out to `n3ar#2697` on discord if you would like to join a meeting or send an email to n3ar0h+REV@gmail.com.

### I gave a presentation, what should I do with the slides?
Open a PR with the file appropriately named! If you presented and you **don't** remember to open a PR with it, now worries! I will open one for you.

### How do I suggest a paper I want the group to cover?
Create an issue with the paper that you want to add. If the paper passes the sniff test, you will be assigned the paper for agreed upon date. If circumstances are such that you cannot present it, it will be reviewed at the next meeting and, if someone wants to claim it, they can! If no one is interested in the topic, it will be closed. If you add and/ or request a paper, make every effort to show up to the session it is being reviewed and the session it is being presented if you arne't the presenter. 

### Can I suggest an adjusted paper order?
Sure! Open an issue with the `discussion` tag!

### How do I volunteer to present on a paper?
Assign yourself the `presentation` labeled issue on the paper you want to present! If, for some reason you can't, just a comment and you will be added to the repo and assigned.
