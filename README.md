# REVelry
Repository for proposed papers and presentations.

## Participation
I gave a presentation, what should I do with the slides? Open a PR with the file appropriately named!
How do I suggest a paper I want the group to cover. Open a PR with the added paper at the bottom of the proposed presentations list.
Can I suggest an adjusted paper order? Sure! Open a PR and we can discuss.
How do I volunteer to present on a paper? Toss your name next to the paper and submit a PR.

## General Rules
If someone mentions something during a session, it isn't yours to steal.
If someone is working on something you want to help with, reach out to them.
You may not recruit here, but you can reach out to individuals if you are looking for a new role yourself.
